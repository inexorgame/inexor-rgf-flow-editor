# inexor-rgf-flow-editor

This repo is experimental.

## Idea

1. Use tauri to provide a full application which is able to combine frontend and backend
2. Integrate the Inexor RGF runtime via the tauri backend
3. Integrate VSCode Web
4. Implement the flow editor as set of extensions for VSCode web

## Build

Important: Use Node 16, not 18
